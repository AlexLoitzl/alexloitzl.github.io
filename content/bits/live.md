summary: "I have finally managed move away from websites I've slapped together from examples I found online and am now using <a href='example.com'>hugo</a> to build my personal website. I adapted the theme by <a href=''> Pascal Michaillat</a> based on <a href=''>PaperMod</a>. To keep living in my emacs world, I am using <a href=''>ox-hugo</a> so that I can write posts and updates in org-mode. I hope the ease of posting updates keeps me motivated to start filling this page with exciting things I care about."
